# Neovim Config
My personal [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) config, entirely written in lua.

I shamelessly copied and got inspired from:
- [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)

I also want to give a shoutout to [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw)
